MojoAuth provides a secure and delightful experience to your customer with passwordless. Here, you'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you to start working with MojoAuth APIs.

== Description ==

The [MojoAuth](https://mojoauth.com) Passwordless Authentication WordPress plugin replaces standard WordPress login forms with the passwordless authentication method. It provides a robust and secure passwordless authentication mechanism to your WordPress site that offers the users a way to verify themselves while not having to remember or manually type passwords, which in turn provides stronger security and fewer breaches.

Adding a passwordless authentication mechanism will help to create additional barriers to secure accounts of users. We updated the conventional password method of login with a safer authentication method, for example, login through OTP, Magic Link and WebAuthn. This likewise cuts the additional progression of you fumbling over your failed to remember password.

### KEY FEATURES

 - **Magic Link**: A unique link sent directly to your email which allows you to authenticate once and becomes invalid automatically once you are logged in.
 - **OTP**: A unique OTP sent directly to your email which allows you to authenticate once and becomes invalid automatically once you are logged in.
 - **WebAuthn**: Allow users to authenticate with built-in authenticators like fingerprint, pin, or using security keys like YubiKey.
